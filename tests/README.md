# Test snippets

This directory contains a set of test snippets which can be run in python.


## Running with CPython + RustPython

One way to run these snippets is by using CPython to do the parsing and
compilation to bytecode. When this is done, run the bytecode with rustpython.

## Running with RustPython

The other option is to run all snippets with RustPython.
